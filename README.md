### Context

Arr-bary is an end-to-end tool to spin up infrastructure and resources commonly
used to host Plex servers and all underlying apps to support retrieving and
managing legally ripped DVDs.

The name is derived from combining the popular 'Serv-Arr-Stack' name with
'Barbary', short for Barbary coast it was a stretch of North Africa's
Mediterranean coast infamous for its pirate havens between the 16th and early
19th centuries.
